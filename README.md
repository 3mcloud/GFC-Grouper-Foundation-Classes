# Grouper Foundation Classes (GFC)

  The GFC framework is a reusable and extensible foundation class library, on which and through
  which all 3M components will be built, consisting of common framework and common 
  business objects.
  
  
  Furthermore, the GFC project aligns with 3M TLO strategies and addressing challenges like:

  - Ensuring proper operation in SOA environment
  - Modernizing component architecture (data handling, code architecture, interfacing, OO design)
  - Optimizing performance (multi-threading, multi-processing capability, efficient architecture)
  - Lowering maintenance cost
  - Producing more reusable code
  - Simplifying the code base
  - Dependency management
  - Inter-component dependency management
  - Providing legacy compatibility
  - Creating a more consistent design between our deliverables
