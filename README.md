# Grouper Foundation Classes (GFC)

The GFC framework is a reusable and extensible foundation class library, on which and through which
all future C&amp;ER components (groupers, editors, ...) will be built, consisting of common
framework and common business objects that support our primary grouper deliverables.

The GFC project addresses challenges like:

- Ensuring proper operation in SOA environment
- Modernizing grouper architecture (data handling, code architecture, interfacing, OO design)
- Optimizing performance (multi-threading, multi-processing capability, efficient architecture)
- Lowering maintenance cost
- Producing more reusable code
- Simplifying the code base
- Dependency management
- Inter-component dependency management
- Providing legacy compatibility
- Creating a more consistent design between our deliverables

-------------------------

## Software Requirements

- Java 1.8 Runtime Environment or higher
- The latest distribution of Grouper Foundation Classes (GFC)

------------------------------

## Base API

This project contains the **very minimal classes and interfaces needed to implement a GFC
component**.
